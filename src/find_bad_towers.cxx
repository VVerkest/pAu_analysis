//Isaac Mooney, WSU - June 2019
//This file determines a preliminary bad tower list for any dataset [just change the file/hist name(s) to adapt]
//It takes in histograms of frequency and energy per tower from the output of the QA,
//finds the mean* and the RMS in order to drop towers outside of mean+-3*sigma.
//First towers are dropped by checking the per-event frequency, then the
//average energy, and finally the average energy above 2 GeV.
//A tower in the normal range for all three is a good tower.
//NOTE: this is currently used for pAu 2015, which has bad calibration so half the towers are higher average frequency/energy than the others and must be averaged separately. To use the file in general, just remove all of this doubling in the remove_towers() function.
