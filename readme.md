# To do list:
* [ ] Bad run list:
    -> Are there really only ``good runs'' left in the TStarJetPico files,
       or do we need to keep and read a local ``bad run list''?
* [ ] Add the TH1D trigger (500206) for the Acoplanarity and AJ measurements
* [ ] Perhaps add the 500004 trigger (although 500401 *may* work)
* [ ] Xsection weighted by numbers of events in each bin
      (Isaac has done the work for his data, but will our cuts match?)

-- and many, many, more
