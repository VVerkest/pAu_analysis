Plots for preliminary:
[X] <pT> as fn of lead pT
[X] <dNch/dEtadPhi> as fn of lead pT
[X] <pT> as fn of lead eta
[X] <dNch/dEtadPhi> as fn of lead eta
[X] jet BBCEsum by lead eta
[X] dijet BBCEsum by lead eta
[ ] old full rho


Description for jetcorr:

I have produced plots of charged <pT> and <dNch/dEtadPhi> as functions of lead
pT and lead eta. In these plots, lead jet pT is the lead jet pT that
has been corrected for UE, but the jet energy scale has not been
corrected. <pT> and <dNch/dEtadPhi> have been corrected for tracking
efficiency, and the systematics shown are due to tracking
efficiency. Additionally, I have produced plots of BBCEsum
distributions for different lead jet eta for both jet and di-jet events.

HP to-dos:

[X] Produce corrected <dN/dEtadPhi> by using corrected pT spectrum
[X] Run over files to do lead pT correction during run-time
[ ] Ask Dave how large is the pileup uncertainty -- percentage??
[X] Apply systematics to plots
[ ] Begin poster
[X] Produce UE pT vs eta vs lead pT differentially in lead eta

[regarding pilup correction]
Hi Veronica, not sure how much difference it makes, but my brain is just catching up with my mouth. My existing preliminary is unfolded for embedding. However, the difference is from unfolding the low ZDCx (<7kHz) vs all the data (7-24kHz)
So it's a little more complicated than I had said


Also, totally random bit of advice: in the code, it's moderately better to pass around "vector<PseudoJet>&" vs "vector<PseudoJet>". (There are cases where this is *not* true -- if you have a copy you want to modify )
But I was only perusing the code to find something for Helen last week, so maybe it's not applicable
